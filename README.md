 Python application to ping nodes and guess distance


Main Language = Python
UI = tkinter

Pings will display from all 4 nodes
Avg pings will be what is used to calculate calibration of location

IPs of nodes will be shared across network

Need to show a graph with points

x and y are known distances (user inputs, measures themselves)

There is a mid-point in the middle of nodes

Should be able to move around according to ping avg

Need to calibrate accuracy according to avg pings with some multiplier


Ability to add and subtract nodes as optional
